# Dev
This folder contains my personal development setup.

## `EvT-new/datasets_scripts/`
- `dvs128_testing.ipynb`: notebook that implements **Event preprocessing**, **Event-frame building**, and **activated patch extraction**.
- `lynx_testing.ipynb`: notebook that implements **frame preprocessing**, **temporal window (Δt) building**, **adapted event-frame building**, and **activated patch extraction**.

This directory is used to test the **xR-EvT transformer** on a completely different dataset (**LynX**) that the model has never seen, in order to evaluate how well it generalizes.

⚠️ For now it's on the `papers_code/` directory
